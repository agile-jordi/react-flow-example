# react-flow-example

A React.js example project written in Flow. Just a work in progress pet project I use to learn:
- Gulp
- Browserify
- React
- Flowtype

Gulp configuration mostly based on [Gulp Starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter), wich I didn't fork in order to be able to learn while copying by hand.
